              Dear Students, Parents, and Guardians, one of the critical
              decisions for any parent, guardian, or student is to choose the
              right college, institute, or university for higher education. The
              decision often depends on senior secondary scores, entrance exam
              results, and ranks obtained, often ignoring the studentâ€™s future
              career goals. Many students fall prey to a rat race, influenced by
              lucrative advertisements, fee discounts, and false promises made
              by institutions.

              conventional medical and engineering degrees. The university
              complies with NEP 2020, emphasizing vocationalization,
              entrepreneurship development, incubation, and mentoring as its key
              strategies.
