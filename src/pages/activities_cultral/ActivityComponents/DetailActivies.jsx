        "A skitt play on social media can creatively depict its impact on everyday life, blending humor and serious moments to deliver an engaging message. The story might follow a group of friends navigating different aspects of social media, such as seeking validation through likes, falling into the trap of misinformation, or dealing with cyberbullying. Alongside these challenges, the skit can also show positive aspects, like staying connected with loved ones, learning new skills, or spreading awareness for social causes. By portraying relatable scenarios, exaggerated behaviors, and thought-provoking outcomes, the play can encourage the audience to reflect on their own social media habits and promote mindful usage.",
